/// when requesting a plugin, first search in it's own database, then
/// in the other default user configured databases, and then in all
/// the known ones, going from the oldest to the newest

/// Enum, that represents an interplugin request and either contains
/// a [`InterplugRequest::RequestCrucial`] plugin request (must be provided
/// in order for the plugin to work or an
/// [`InterplugRequest::RequestOptional`] plugin request which may be
/// denied
///
/// For more complex situations, when several plugins might provide
/// similar functionality, [`InterplugRequest::RequestEither`] may be used
/// to provide several requests, each of which may be fulfilled
/// for the plugin to work correctly. In case this  functionality
/// may also be provided by several different plugins together,
/// [`InterplugRequest::RequestEach`] should be used.
///
/// If the request is optional, the final decision to provide it
/// or not to provide it is supposed to be made by the user. For
/// example, if user needs some function from a plugin, that
/// requires an optional interplug request to be fulfilled, they
/// just add it to the dependencies, so the program, that provides
/// the dependencies, when seeing this request finds out that
/// the plugin that was requested was already loaded earlier,
