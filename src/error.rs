/// Enum, that represents a message passed to the program using the
/// plugin when the function fails.
///
/// Interplugin communication is meant to be panic safe, so that
/// the program does not just completely fail just because one plugin
/// failed. Instead if the plugin fails to perform any action, instead
/// of the normal return value, it should return [`Error`], so
/// that it could be parsed by the program, and considered when making
/// the decision to either try and fix the problem by providing
/// dependencies, trying another plugin, or notifying user in the most
/// comprehensible way possible of what the problem is and how it might
/// possibly be solved.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// fn add (
///     a: u8,
///     b: u8,
/// ) -> Result<u8, dusk_api::Error> {
///
///     if ((255 - b) < a) {
///         return Err(dusk_api::OverflowError(
///             format!(
///                 "Result ({}) does not fit in one byte",
///                 a as usize + b as usize,
///                 )));
///     }
///     return Ok(a + b);
/// }
///
/// fn add_many (
///     lst: Vec<u8>,
/// ) -> Result<u8, dusk_api::Error> {
///
///     let mut res: u8 = 0;
///     for elm in lst {
///         res = add(elm, res)?;
///     }
///     return Ok(res);
/// }
///
/// assert!(add(1, 2).is_ok());
/// assert!(add_many(vec![1, 2, 3]).is_ok());
///
/// assert!(!add(100, 200).is_ok());
/// assert!(!add_many(vec![100, 200, 30]).is_ok());
/// ```
